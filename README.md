Assignment: CSS Hell
====================
Three html files containing books from Project Gutenberg are in the folder gutenberg. All three are styled with the same stylesheet, gutenberg.css.
The portfolio folder contains two html files, good.html and bad.html. They are the same except they link to different stylesheets.
Screenshots of each project part are contained in the screenshots folder of the gutenberg and portfolio folders.
index.html in the root folder displays screenshots that are linked to their respective pages.
The site is hosted on Github pages at [http://dsopel.github.io/](http://dsopel.github.io/)

Project Gutenberg Skins
=======================

The only change I made to the Gutenberg html files was adding a link to the stylesheet: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="gutenberg.css">.
Gutenberg CSS changes three books to show green text on a black background. This was inspired by "The Matrix". Gutenberg.css also changes the style of the headings, preformatted blocks, and links to present an attractive modern theme to the reader.
The borders and background of the page numbers of atommystery.html are designed to look like the open pages of a physical book.
