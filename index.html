<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
I am a fourth year computer science student at the University of Alberta. I have studied team software development, version control, 
and web design. Technologies I am proficient in include C, Java, Python, and SQL. I have completed several group projects with teams of five students,
demonstrating I work well with others. One of my group members has noted that I work well under time pressure. I am competent working individually as well and I enjoy self-directed learning. 
</p>

<p>
I am looking for a position in a software development company that encourages self-directed learning. I am a punctual and reliable worker
and I am enthusiastic and motivated to learn new things.  I am responsible and skilled at working with clients.

<h2>Development History</h2>
<h4>September 2016-December 2016</h4>
<h4>Project: Distributed Social Networking</h4>
<p>I created a bloggin/social network platform that aggregates posts from other social networks with a team of four other developers.
The project is like a simpler version of <a href="https://diasporafoundation.org/">diaspora.org</a>. The project is RESTful and well 
documented.
</p>
<h4>September 2016-October 2016</h4>
<h4>Project: Memory Scanner</h4>
<p> I worked with a partner to write a C program that scans all the pages in memory and returns a list of blocks of memory that
contain contiguous pages with the same permissions (read only, read-writeable, and inaccessible). We also wrote three driver programs
to test and demonstrate the memory scanning functions.
</p>
<h4>September 2016</h4>
<h4>Webserver</h4>
<p>
I individually wrote a partially HTTP 1.1 compliant webserver in Python that serves static content.
</p>
<h4>October 2016</h4>
<h4>Web Client</h4>
<p>
I developed a partially HTTP 1.1 compliant web client that can GET and POST to a webserver.
